# KPicoSim
KPicoSim is a development environment for the Xilinx PicoBlaze-3 soft-core processor for the KDE Desktop (Linux). The environment has an editor with syntax highlighting, compiler, simulator and export functions to VHDL, HEX and MEM files. It provides more or less the same functionality as the Mediatronix pBlazeIDE (windows).
